# ML Fundamentals

A collection of machine learning projects exploring fundamental concepts and algorithms.

## Project Structure

### 📊 Linear Regression
**Folder:** `linear-regression/`

Introduction to linear regression fundamentals using a bikers dataset. Learn how to model relationships between variables and make predictions.

- `linear-regression.ipynb` - Main notebook with implementations and examples
- `bikers_data.csv` - Dataset containing biking/weather data

### 🏠 Housing Price Regression
**Folder:** `housing-price-regression/`

Apply regression techniques to predict house prices. A practical project that demonstrates real-world regression applications.

- `housing-price-regression.ipynb` - Complete project notebook
- `house_prices.txt` - Housing dataset

### 🔀 Logistic Regression
**Folder:** `logistic-regression/`

Classification using logistic regression. Includes work with spiral datasets for non-linear classification problems.

- `logistic-regression.ipynb` - Logistic regression implementations
- `spiral_features.npy` - Feature data for spiral classification
- `spiral_target.npy` - Target labels for spiral data

### 🖥️ CUDA Environment Check
**File:** `cuda-environment-check.ipynb`

Utility notebook for verifying CUDA setup and GPU availability on your system.

## Getting Started

Each project is self-contained as a Jupyter notebook. To get started:

1. Install required dependencies (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, etc.)
2. Open any notebook in Jupyter and run the cells
3. Experiment with the code and modify parameters to deepen your understanding

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## License

Feel free to use and modify these projects for learning purposes.
